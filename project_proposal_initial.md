## Description: 

This project will investigate how Steam sales influence long-term purchasing behavior. Questions include: Do greater discounts lead to short-term sales spikes, or do they cultivate long-term customer engagement? How might consumers’ price sensitivity and behavior change over time due to repeated sales events? Through quantitative data from SteamDB,  insight can be extracted about how consumer behavior evolves around sales events.
  
  

## Intellectual Merit: 
This research can uncover novel insights and patterns into digital consumer behavior, particularly in the gaming industry in terms of digital game pricing, purchasing decisions, and other relevant topics. The project will advance the understanding behind how price reductions impact purchasing decisions beyond immediate gains, potentially showing whether discounts contribute to long-term sales growth, merely encourage one-off purchases, or provide entirely new insight.
  
  

## Data Sourcing: 
The data will be sourced from SteamDB’s records on sales and game pricing. These records contain comprehensive information about a game's pricing, discounts, sales, and user engagement metrics. The analysis will focus on utilizing quantitative data such as price drops, sales numbers, and time frames of sales. While SteamDB offers historical sales data, the methodology of public data will involve parsing and cleaning this dataset. However, it is also worth nothing that scraping is not allowed for SteamDB directly, but it has documentation for another method to obtain data. Per the FAQ, I can request data from them for academic purposes, as they do not allow direct data access or data dumps.

### A meta-analysis of the impact of price presentation on perceived savings

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-4359(02)00072-6
- Many findings, here are a few:
	- Consumers value savings on bundles less as the bundle size increases. This finding is open to multiple hypotheses as to the cause and would be fruitful area for future research.
	- Deals are more effective if they are less consistent (predictable) and more distinctive.
	- Including free gifts in general lowers the perceived value of the deal.
