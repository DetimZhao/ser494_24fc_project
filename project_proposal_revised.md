## Description: 
This project centers on clustering Steam games using a range of attributes, including user review sentiment, genre, category, and more, to uncover distinct patterns that reflect consumer preferences. By analyzing these factors, the study aims to identify clusters of games that can guide developers, marketers, and consumers alike. This approach may help consumers find games that align with their interests across a range of factors they may not have initially considered, such as genre, price, category, or sentiment trends in user reviews. The clusters generated from this analysis could serve as a useful tool for navigating the expansive game library on Steam, helping players discover titles that align closely with their preferences and play style. It may also offer valuable information for developers and marketers who seek to understand and respond to user feedback more effectively.

## Intellectual Merit

The potential of this project lies in advancing knowledge around user behavior and game characteristics in the digital gaming market, particularly through novel combinations of review sentiment analysis and clustering of game features. By leveraging diverse game attributes—such as genre, category, pricing, and review sentiment—this project explores nuanced consumer patterns within the gaming ecosystem. 

The clustering outcomes aim to uncover previously unobserved correlations between game attributes and user satisfaction, helping to identify what defines different types of games from a consumer’s perspective. This research could reveal new insights into how specific game features influence user preferences and, ultimately, how they drive engagement and satisfaction in different gaming niches. These insights can contribute meaningfully to fields like digital marketing, game development, and consumer behavior analysis, offering data-driven strategies for better understanding and meeting the needs of diverse gaming audiences.
